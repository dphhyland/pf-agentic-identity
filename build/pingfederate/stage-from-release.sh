#   <dir>       a directory holding a release's assets (what release.yml puts in dist/), used where it is
#   (neither)   PFAI_RELEASE from release.env beside this script; the public tree has one, the internal
#               repository does not, and there the argument is required
#
#   PFAI_RELEASE_REPO      owner/name the release is fetched from (default: release.env's, else
#                          ID-Partners/pf-agentic-identity)

#
# The release is trusted only as far as its SHA256SUMS: that is fetched first, then every file it lists, and
# nothing is staged unless every file verifies - a directory source is held to the same check, and a file in it
# that SHA256SUMS does not list is refused. Fetches send no credentials (release assets are anonymous; GH_TOKEN
# is never read). The jars staged are exactly the ones the release's MANIFEST lists, under its sections, each
# with the digest the MANIFEST gives; the conformance profile adds the CIBA simulator, which a release carries as
# demo-only-ciba-sim.jar so that nothing globbing pf.plugins.* picks it up, staged under the name PingFederate
# needs, pf.plugins.ciba-sim.jar. The production profile never stages it. A release with no
# war-assembler-<version>.jar - everything before 0.7.0 - is refused: the image build cannot assemble without it.
