# Boot shim: check the PF config archive, decrypt it, put it where the drop-in deployer looks, then hand
# over to the base image's bootstrap with the decryption key gone from the environment.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A PF configArchive is a plain zip that CONTAINS pf.jwk - the master key that
# decrypts every secret inside it - along with the system keys, both keystores and the admin password
# hash. Baking one into an image layer publishes the key to anyone who can pull the image, exactly as
# committing one publishes it to anyone who can clone the repo. This project has done both.
#
# Note a layer trap this also closes: staging the key and deleting it in a later RUN does NOT remove it
# from the image - the earlier layer still carries it, and `docker save` yields it. The only version
# that holds is never putting it in a layer at all.
#
# So the archive ships encrypted with age, and is decrypted here, at boot, using an identity supplied
# as a mounted secret file or a sealed runtime variable that is never in git and never in a layer.
#
# WHERE THE PLAINTEXT GOES. Into the drop-in directory under PF_DATA_DIR, on the container's writable
# layer - not a tmpfs, unless one is mounted there (README.md: "Where the plaintext lives"). The base
# image's bootstrap then copies PF_DATA_DIR, like everything under /opt/in, into /opt/staging and
# /opt/out/instance, so the plaintext archive and the keys exist in three places for the life of the
# container. What this script guarantees is narrower and holds: none of them is in an image layer.
#
# EVERY START DECRYPTS. The ciphertext is kept, and each start of the container - the first, and every
# restart that keeps its writable layer - decrypts it again over the plaintext the last start wrote, so each
# start needs the identity (F-0313). The plaintext a start wrote is never what a later start boots from:
# while the ciphertext is there it is chosen and the plaintext overwritten. A plaintext archive is chosen
# only when no ciphertext is, and production refuses it.
#
# THE ONE SECRET. pf.jwk is NOT supplied separately. It is extracted from the archive, which keeps the
# invariant that matters: the running key is by construction the key the archive was encrypted under.
# Supplying them separately is how an archive and a key drift apart, and a PF whose key does not match
# its archive fails in a way that reads like data corruption.
#
# Env:
#   PF_ARCHIVE_FILE          the archive to boot from: age-encrypted (preferred; binary or `age -a` armored)
#                            or a plain configArchive, told apart by content. Default: data.zip.age in the
#                            drop-in directory, else data.zip there. A mounted secret is the usual reason
#                            to set it.
#   PF_ARCHIVE_AGE_KEY_FILE  a path to the age identity (a mounted secret file). Preferred.
#   PF_ARCHIVE_AGE_KEY       the identity itself (AGE-SECRET-KEY-1...). Read only when _FILE is unset.
#                            Both are removed from the environment before PingFederate starts.
#   PF_ARCHIVE_SHA256        optional: the archive's SHA-256, hex. Checked before the archive is decrypted
#                            or imported; a mismatch stops the boot.
#   PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA  YES (or Y, in any case) accepts Ping Identity's licence agreement. The image does
#                            not accept it for you: anything else, or unset, stops the boot here, before the
#                            base image's licence hook runs.
#   OIDF_DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE  development lets a plaintext archive boot and PingFederate's plain HTTP listener
#                            open; production - the default when unset, and what any other value counts as -
#                            refuses both. The Java modules read it through libs/platform's DeploymentProfile;
#                            DeploymentProfileShellTest holds is_development to that rule, padding included
#                            (trimmed as Java's String.trim does: F-0161).
#   PF_RUN_PF_HTTP_PORT      PingFederate's plain HTTP runtime listener (pf.http.port, which the Dockerfile has
#                            the base image's template read from this variable). Unset or negative: off, as
#                            PingFederate ships it. A port: on, in development only - production refuses it.
#   PF_DATA_DIR              where the archive and keys go (default /opt/in/instance/server/default/data).
#   PF_BOOTSTRAP             the base image's bootstrap (default /opt/bootstrap.sh); test-entrypoint.sh
#                            points it at a stub.
#
